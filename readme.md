At this state I noticed my AI using the word 'daddy' significantly more than any other word,
I was quite interested on why this was as the word had 3 repeating letters thus, making it a really bad choice.
I struggled to find the reason, until it hit me that in my current reward method the word 'daddy' is 
converted into 'd', 'a', 'y' . the correct letter 'a' rewards it 50 points, and both the wrong 'd' and 'y' 
cumulatively only penalizes it with -10 points. I should perhaps punish the restructure how I reward a choice.
